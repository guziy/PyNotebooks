    "# Minimum work required to bend a metallic rod\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is from the section on deformations obbeying the linear relation between reaction force and \n",
    "deformation length. This one requires knowledge of Young modulus which allows to express reaction force as a function of relative deformation. In one-dimensional case the law looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = E\\varepsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma=F/A$ is the reaction tension (${\\rm N/m^2}$) of the material in response to the relative deformation $\\varepsilon=\\Delta L / L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is taken from the book Savchenko et al and it took me some time to understand to my satisfaction, therefore it is written up here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem statement\n",
    "Determine the **minimum** amount of work required to bend a rod of length $l$ with square cross section ($a \\times a$) into a ring. Young modulus of the material is $E$ and $l \\gg a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to take here was hinted to me by the previous problem which asked for the expression of the energy density for a deformed material. It is relatively easy to derive using the above expression for the deformation tension that the energy density per unit volume ($\\omega$) can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega = \\frac{dW}{dV} = \\frac{E\\varepsilon^2}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the problem now is reduced to finding the ring configuration that would minimize the energy (work) due to deformation of the rod:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W = \\int\\omega dV \\Rightarrow W_{\\rm min} = \\min_{V_{\\rm ring}}\\left( \\int \\omega dV \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bent state we can divide the ring into multiple strips of width $dr$ with the smallest having the radius $R$. We assume that the length of the longest (outer) strip would be $R+a$, i.e. here we neglect radial deformations and assume that the width of the rod as well as its height won't change. Then the deformation energy $dW$ stored in each strip would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dW = \\omega dV = \\frac{E\\varepsilon^2}{2}dV =\\frac{E\\varepsilon^2}{2}a\\cdot 2\\pi r dr \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the total energy of the deformed rod would be a sum of energy of each of the strips:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W = \\int\\limits_{R}^{R+a}\\frac{E\\varepsilon^2}{2}a\\cdot 2\\pi r dr \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then noting that for each strip the relative deformation $\\varepsilon$ is $(2 \\pi r -l )/l $, we get:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W(R) = \\int\\limits_{R}^{R+a}\\frac{E(2 \\pi r - l)^2}{2l^2}a\\cdot 2\\pi r dr \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to find the radius of the shortest strip $R$ (which would also define the radii of all the longer strips) that minimizes $W(R)$, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_{\\min} = \\min_{R} W(R) = \\min_{R}\\left( \\int\\limits_{R}^{R+a}\\frac{E(2 \\pi r - l)^2}{2l^2}a\\cdot 2\\pi r dr \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, I figured that the minimizing configuration would include the undeformed strip (i.e. the one in bent state having the same length $l$ as before). To minimize the deviations of the other strips, the undeformed strip would have to be in the middle, so that leaves us with $R = \\frac{l}{2\\pi} - \\frac{a}{2}$ and once we have this the solution is straightforward. But I still would like to find the minimizing $R$ in a more rigorous way.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one accepts the above arguments then (If not please see another way of determining $R$ in the note section at the end of the post) the expression for $W_{\\min}$ becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_{\\min}=W\\left(R=\\frac{l}{2\\pi} - \\frac{a}{2}\\right)=\\int\\limits_{\\frac{l}{2\\pi} - \\frac{a}{2}}^{\\frac{l}{2\\pi} + \\frac{a}{2}}\\frac{E(2 \\pi r - l)^2}{2l^2}a\\cdot 2\\pi r dr\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Making a substitution $y = 2 \\pi r$:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Noticing that the first integral above is from an odd function over a symmetric interval with respect to 0, therefore it is 0 (or you could simply integrate to convince yourself) and we get:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_{\\min} = \\frac{Ea}{4\\pi l^2}l\\cdot\\int\\limits_{- \\pi a}^{\\pi a}z^2 dz = \\frac{Ea}{4\\pi l^2}l\\cdot \\frac{2 \\pi^3 a^3}{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then simplifying we get the final expression for the minimum amount of work needed to bend the rod:\n",
