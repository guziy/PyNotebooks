    "# Wave propagation, reflection, and superposition inside a solid rod\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is  about a problem on wave propagation in a solid rod. I took it from Savchenko et al 1981. Before I continue the discussion, I have to present you the problem statement, which goes as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Given a harmonic force acting on a free end of a rod of length $L$. A standing wave is formed due to multiple reflections. Determine locations of nodes (points with 0 stress) in the standing wave of deformations. Determine the amplitude of the external force if the if the amplitude of the stress in the standing wave in the rod is $\\sigma_0$ and the rod cross-section is $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to write up the solution here due to the amount of time I spent figuring it out. Another reason is that it is easy to get an answer close to the correct one by following a wrong solution method. Which might lead someone to think that there is a typo in the book. I know I was considering this possibility myself, even went to check the newer edition, but no luck, the problem answers and statements are identical in both editions. Therefore I continued to break my head over this problem. My mistake was that I somehow considered only two first reflections assuming that would be enough. But when I realized that there are many more relevant reflections I managed to get the correct answer.\n",

    "Let's consider a point in the rod at a distance $x$ from the end of the rod opposite to the one where the external force $F$ is applied (Fig. 2). The stress at the point $x$ can be computed as a superposition of stress deformations after 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., $n$, ... reflections from the rod edges. Let's denote these stress values as $P_0, P_1, ...$ and the speed of the propagation of deformations in the rod as $c$. Then $P_0$ at $x$ can be expressed using the time delay it takes for the disturbances to propagate from the end where the force is applied to the point $x$ as follows:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative sign appearing in the above equation for $P_1$ is due to the reflection from the rode edges where we consider that compression deformations are transformed into stretching deformations and inversely. Therefore, following the above considerations we can express stresses at point $x$ after 2,3, ... , $n$ reflections from the rod edges.\n",
