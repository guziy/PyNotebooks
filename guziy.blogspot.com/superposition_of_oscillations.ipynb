    "# Superposition of two harmonic oscillations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is about backward engineering properties of combined oscillations from the resulting superposed motion. In some way it is a simplified form of the harmonic analysis. And my curiosity for it was induced by a problem from Savchenko et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has taken my mind for quite some time so I decided to write it up here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem statement**\n",
    "Given the graph of a motion resulting from a superposition of *two* harmonic oscillations determine amplitudes and frequencies of the constituent oscillations (i.e. of the oscillations being combine to get the net motion).\n",

    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the graph the resulting motion can be expressed as:\n",

    "x(t) = a_1\\sin\\omega_1 t + a_2\\sin\\omega_2 t \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to determine $a_1, a_2, \\omega_1, \\omega_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we apply transformations to the equation to present it in the following form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x(t) = \\hat A (t) \\sin(\\omega_0 t + \\hat\\phi)\n",

    "The ideas for the transformations are taken from this [lecture](https://www.dacollege.org/smat/physics-sem2-Acoustics.pdf).\n",

    "At first I wrote a sum of two harmonics and was trying to see if there is something simple relating amplitudes or frequencies of the two terms to the graph of the net motion. But I could not see an easy way to relate those, and decided to work out the formula for the net graph and from there, maybe, I could get some kind of sum of two harmonic functions.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is no way this could be brough to the sum of 2 harmonics. It is easy to see when the multiplication is performed there is a product of sines and that leads to two more harmonics.. I even calculated a quick Fourier transform for the funcition and got the confirmation that this function has energy localized at three frequencies: $\\omega_0$, $\\omega_0 \\pm \\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time was going and as I was more curious I started googling and reading about superposition of harmonic oscillations. And I found just what I needed in a physics lecture on acoustics ([link](https://www.dacollege.org/smat/physics-sem2-Acoustics.pdf)), that brought me easily to answer the question about the amplitudes, although to work out the frequencies I had to work a but more.\n",
