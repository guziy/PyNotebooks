    "### Introduction and problem statement\n",
    "This problem, as many others appearing here, took me a lot of time to wrap my head around. I almost lost faith, even tried to ask ChatGPT to solve it for me few times, but ChatGPT's solution was wrong or completely obscure for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the problem statement (translated by ChatGPT from the Savchenko et al 1981 book).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem statement:** In 1941, the Germans invented a cumulative anti-tank shell. The shell has a fuse on its front part, which, upon impact, causes detonation and ignites the entire charge. The shell penetrates the armor. In 1944, such German shells came into the hands of both the Soviets and their allies. Extensive experiments began. Various additional effects and paradoxes were discovered. The researchers started to investigate what exactly was penetrating the armor. At first, they thought it was a jet of hot gas that burns through the armor. However, it turned out that a metal jet is piercing through the armor traveling in a very puzzling way: in front of the plate at a speed of $v_{0} = {\\rm 8\\;km/s}$, inside the plate at ${\\rm 4\\;km/s}$, and behind the armor plate again at ${\\rm 8\\;km/s}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explain this phenomenon and determine the speed of the metal wall of the conical cavity covering the charge, given that the cone’s vertex angle is 30°.\n",
    "\n",

    "I have to admit that the translation is pretty accurate.\n",

    "The problem consists of two parts. The first one asks to explain the phenomenon and the second one asks to determine the speed of the collapsing conical wall that is separating the fuse and the explosive charge of the shell, this collapsing wall is forming the metal jet piercing through the armor. I'll proceed in the order I solved it initially, starting with the part 2.\n"

    "\n",
    "The breaking moment for me here was to realize that the velocity of the conical wall is orthogonal to its surface ($\\vec{v}$ in Fig. 2). Since it is collapsing under the pressure force of the gas/liquid created to the left of the cone surface after the explosion of the charge.\n",

    "The first part of the problem is to explain the phenomenon, mainly why the speed decreases by a factor of two in the armor. It is more or less clear that the jet will slow down due to the friction with the armor and then will accelerate back behind the armoured wall to the initial speed as it is being pushed forward. The factor of two for the velocity can be explained by the size of the hole pierced by the jet in the armoured wall (as shown in Fig. 3) which is two times larger than the diameter of the jet. \n"

For this we need to consider the moments before the hole is pierced completely. At this point there is a part of the jet that flows backwards reflected from the armor as shown in Fig.4 below, which expands the hole. The symmetry and mass conservation would hint us towards the factor of two for the hole diameter.\n",

    "To find the angle at which the backward flow is reflected we can consider two colliding jets of liquid: smaller with a radius $r$ and a larger one with a radius $R$, moving towards each other at equal and parallel speeds (we can always switch to the reference frame where the metallic jet and the armoured wall move at equal speeds towards each other). As a result of the collision of the jets, a conical backflow in the direction of the smaller jet is formed. If we denote the angle of the cone as $2\\beta$, then using momentum, mass and energy conseration it is relatively easy to show that the angle of the cone can be computed using dimensions of the colliding jets as follows:\n",
